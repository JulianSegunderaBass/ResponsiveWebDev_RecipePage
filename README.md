<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

For this project, I spent most of my time working with the typography and fonts. This page was good practice for the smaller font elements like font weights, colors and line spacing. The layout of the elements themselves was relatively simple; lots of nested flex and grid containers to create gaps where needed.

My biggest challenge was managing my reusable CSS classes. I found myself fumbling every now and then with duplicate styles to try and modularize the different font styles. Another minor challenge was working with the sizing of the input check boxes. I found the best way to make the boxes bigger without messing with alignment was using CSS scaling and setting a transform origin from the top left.
